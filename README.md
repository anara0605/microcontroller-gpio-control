# Embedded Systems Fundamentals: GPIO Control

This project demonstrates core embedded systems concepts by implementing firmware to control an LED using a microcontroller's GPIO pins.

## Project Overview
- **Microcontroller:** STM32
- **Language:** C
- **Key Concept:** Hardware-Software Integration, Register-Level GPIO Control

## Implementation
- Wrote firmware in C to directly manipulate microcontroller registers.
- Configured GPIO pin as a digital output.
- Implemented a precise software delay loop to create a blinking pattern.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Embedded C Programming
- Microcontroller Architecture
- Hardware/Software Integration
- Debugging and Validation
		for (int i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
			// Busy-wait delay
		}
	}
